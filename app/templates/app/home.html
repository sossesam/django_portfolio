					<h4>My First Job as a Developer with django</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>Last year i began my journey as a developer myself, You see have been a small business owner trying to manage several tasks. But one i wasn't happy with was my website. i used to work with wordpress. but over time, it became expensive and i couldn't make some things i desired without a  plugin. i grew frustrated and started learning coding myself </p>

					<p>This is meant to be my first portfolio website, this i built while learning django. it as no databases. But it's meant to help me understand how the djanngo framework operates.</p>

					<p>From this you’ll see that I’m someone that jumps before I can talk myself out of doing something scary.</p>

					<h5>How I Learn</h5>
					<hr>
					<p>Reverse Engineer & Build Ugly Prototypes First.</p>

					<p>I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear apart piece by piece. I break the code where I need to figure out why things work the way they do. Documentation is just a reference. some helpful tools i use for my designs are frontend mentor, stylestage.dev, frontend practice</p>
